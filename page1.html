    <h3>Number of artworks acquired by the MoMA over the years</h3>
    <p><b>Note:</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only one artwork per artist was considered.</li> 
      <li>Total number of non-binary artists in the entire data-set was only 3. Hence, nothing is visible under that selection</li>
      <li>Collaborations and artworks with missing acquisition date/gender were ignored.</li>
      <li>Art departments such as Film and Fluxus Collection were ignored because the total count for each was less than 100.</li>
      <li>The y-axis was made using a logarithmic scale but still repsents the number of acquisitions.</li>
